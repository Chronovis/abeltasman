We<br>cannot but think that, if we find no land up to 150\u00b0 Longitude,<br>we shall then be in an open sea again, unless we should meet with<br>islands; all which time and experience, being the best of teachers,<br>will no doubt bring to light.<br><br>Signed, Francoys Jacobsz.<br><br></pre><p>In the morning, the wind still westerly with hail and snow so that<br>we had to run on with a furled foresail as before, and as we could<br>not make any progress in this way, we deemed it best to alter our<br>course to northward upon which, with our ship's council together with<br>our second mates, seeing that we could not speak the friends of the<br>Zeehaan, much less get them on board of us, we resolved first to our<br>course north-eastward, running on to 45 or 44\u00b0; having reached<br>the 45th or 44th degree, to direct our course due east until we shall<br>have got to 150\u00b0 Longitude; as will be found duly specified in<br>today's resolution, to which we beg to refer.

When our men<br>had come on board again we inquired of them whether they had been<br>there and made a fire, to which they returned a negative answer,<br>adding however that at various times and points in the wood they also<br>had seen clouds of smoke ascending.

When we had come<br>close inshore in a small inlet which bore west-south-west of the<br>ships the surf ran so high that we could not get near the shore<br>without running the risk of having our pinnace dashed to pieces. We<br>then ordered the carpenter aforesaid to swim to the shore alone with<br>the pole and the flag, and kept by the wind with our pinnace; we made<br>him plant the said pole with the flag at top into the earth, about<br>the centre of the bay near four tall trees easily recognisable and<br>standing in the form of a crescent, exactly before the one standing<br>lowest. This tree is burnt in just above the ground, and in reality<br>taller than the other three, but it seems to be shorter because it<br>stands lower on the sloping ground; at top, projecting from the<br>crown, it shows two long dry branches, so symmetrically set with dry<br>sprigs and twigs that they look like the large antlers of a stag; by<br>the side of these dry branches, slightly lower down, there is another<br>bough which is quite green and leaved all round, whose twigs, owing<br>to their regular proportion, wonderfully embellish the said bough and<br>make it look like the upper part of a larding-pin. Our master<br>carpenter, having in the sight of myself, Abel Jansz Tasman, Skipper<br>Gerrit Jansz, and Subcargo Abraham Coomans, performed the work<br>entrusted to him, we pulled with our pinnace as near the shore as we<br>ventured to do; the carpenter aforesaid thereupon swam back to the<br>pinnace through the surf. This work having been duly executed we<br>pulled back to the ships, leaving the above-mentioned as a memorial<br>for those who shall come after us, and for the natives of this<br>country, who did not show themselves, though we suspect some of them<br>were at no great distance and closely watching our proceedings. We<br>made no arrangements for gathering vegetables since the high seas<br>prevented our men from getting ashore except by swimming, so that it<br>was impossible to get anything into the pinnace. During the whole of<br>the day the wind blew chiefly from the north; in the evening we took<br>the sun's azimuth and found 3\u00b0 north-easterly variation of the<br>compass; at sunset we got a strong gale from the north which by and<br>by rose to so violent a storm from the north-north-west that we were<br>compelled to get both our yards in and drop our small<br>bower-anchor.</p>",

We repeatedly made signs for<br>them to come on board of us, showing them white linen and some knives<br>that formed part of our cargo. They did not come nearer, however, but<br>at last paddled back to shore. In the meanwhile, at our summons sent<br>the previous evening, the officers of the Zeehaan came on board of<br>us, upon which we convened a council and resolved to go as near the<br>shore as we could, since there was good anchoring-ground here, and<br>these people apparently sought our friendship. Shortly after we had<br>drawn up this resolution we saw 7 more boats put off from the shore,<br>one of which (high and pointed in front, manned with 17 natives)<br>paddled round behind the Zeehaan while another, with 13 able-bodied<br>men in her, approached to within half a stone's throw of our ship;<br>the men in these two boats now and then called out to each other; we<br>held up and showed them as before white linens, etc., but they<br>remained where they were. The skipper of the Zeehaan now sent out to<br>them his quartermaster with her cock-boat with six paddlers in it,<br>with orders for the second mates that, if these people should offer<br>to come alongside the Zeehaan, they should not allow too many of them<br>on board of her, but use great caution and be well on their guard.<br>While the cock-boat of the Zeehaan was paddling on its way to her<br>those in the prow nearest to us called out to those who were lying<br>behind the Zeehaan and waved their paddles to them, but we could not<br>make out what they meant. Just as the cock-boat of the Zeehaan had<br>put off from board again those in the prow before us, between the two<br>ships, began to paddle so furiously towards it that, when they were<br>about halfway slightly nearer to our ship, they struck the Zeehaan's<br>cock-boat so violently alongside with the stem of their prow that it<br>got a violent lurch, upon which the foremost man in this prow of<br>villains with a long, blunt pike thrust the quartermaster Cornelis<br>Joppen in the neck several times with so much force that the poor man<br>fell overboard. Upon this the other natives, with short thick clubs<br>which we at first mistook for heavy blunt parangs,<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[1]</b> and with their paddles, fell upon the men in<br>the cock-boat and overcame them by main force, in which fray three of<br>our men were killed and a fourth got mortally wounded through the<br>heavy blows. The quartermaster and two sailors swam to our ship,<br>whence we had sent our pinnace to pick them up, which they got into<br>alive. After this outrageous and detestable crime the murderers sent<br>the cock-boat adrift, having taken one of the dead bodies into their<br>prow and thrown another into the sea.</p><blockquote>[1) Knives used for cutting wood in certain parts of the<br>East Indies.]</blockquote>",

With our fore upper-deck and bow guns we now fired<br>several shots in the direction of their prows, but none of them took<br>effect. There upon our skipper Ide Tercxsen Holman, in command of our<br>pinnace well manned and armed, rowed towards the cock-boat of the<br>Zeehaan (which fortunately for us these accursed villains had let<br>adrift) and forthwith returned with it to our ships, having found in<br>it one of the men killed and one mortally wounded. We now weighed<br>anchor and set sail, since we could not hope to enter into any<br>friendly relations with these people, or to be able to get water or<br>refreshments here. Having weighed anchor and being under sail, we saw<br>22 prows near the shore, of which eleven, swarming with people, were<br>making for our ships. We kept quiet until some of the foremost were<br>within reach of our guns, and then fired 1 or 2 shots from the<br>gun-room with our pieces, without however doing them any harm; those<br>on board the Zeehaan also fired, and in the largest prow hit a man<br>who held a small white flag in his hand, and who fell down. We also<br>heard the canister-shot strike the prows inside and outside, but<br>could not make out what other damage it had done. As soon as they had<br>got this volley they paddled back to shore with great speed, two of<br>them hoisting a sort of tingang<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[1]</b><br>sails. They remained lying near the shore without visiting us any<br>further. About noon skipper Gerrit Jansz and Mr. Gilsemans again came<br>on board of us; we also sent for their first mate and convened the<br>council, with whom we drew up the resolution following, to wit:<br>Seeing that the detestable deed of these natives against four men of<br>the Zeehaan's crew, perpetrated this morning, must teach us to<br>consider the inhabitants of this country as enemies; that therefore<br>it will be best to sail eastward along the coast, following the trend<br>of the land in order to ascertain whether there are any fitting<br>places where refreshments and water would be obtainable; all of which<br>will be found set forth <i>in extenso</i> in this day's resolution.<br>In this murderous spot (to which we have accordingly given the name<br>of <i>Moordenaersbay</i><b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[2]</b>) we lay at<br>anchor on 40\u00b0 50' South Latitude, 191\u00b0 30' Longitude. From<br>here we shaped our course east-north-east. At noon Latitude estimated<br>40\u00b0 57', Longitude 191\u00b0 41'; course kept south, sailed 2<br>miles. In the afternoon we got the wind from the west-north-west<br>when, on the advice of our steersmen and with our own approval, we<br>turned our course north-east by north. During the night we kept<br>sailing as the weather was favourable, but about an hour after<br>midnight we sounded in 25 or 26 fathom, a hard, sandy bottom.

While<br>rowing towards the shore they saw, in various places on the heights,<br>a tall man standing with a long stick like a pike, apparently<br>watching our men. As they were rowing past he had called out to them<br>in a very loud voice; when they had got about halfway to the<br>watering-place, between a certain point and another large high rock<br>or small island, they found the current to run so strongly against<br>the wind that, with the empty boats, they had to do their utmost to<br>hold their own; for which reason the pilot-major and Gerrit Jansz,<br>skipper of the Zeehaan, agreed together to abstain from exposing the<br>small craft and the men to such great peril, seeing that there was<br>still a long voyage before them and the men and the small craft were<br>greatly wanted by the ships.

The pilot-major, having come alongside<br>our ship again with the boats, reported that owing to the wind the<br>attempt to land there was too dangerous, seeing that the sea was<br>everywhere near the shore full of hard rocks without any sandy<br>ground, so that they would have greatly imperilled the men and run<br>the risk of having the water-casks injured or stove in; we forthwith<br>summoned the officers of the Zeehaan and the second mates on board of<br>us, and convened a council in which it was resolved to weigh anchor<br>directly and to run on an easterly course as far as 220\u00b0<br>Longitude, in accordance with the preceding resolution; then to shape<br>our course to northward, or eventually due north, as far as Latitude<br>17\u00b0 South, after which we shall hold our course due west in order<br>to run straight of the Cocos and Hoorense islands, where we shall<br>take in fresh water and refreshments; or if we should meet with any<br>other island before these we shall endeavour to touch at them, in<br>order to ascertain what can be obtained there; all this being duly<br>specified and set forth at length in this day's resolution, to which<br>for briefness sake we beg leave to refer. About noon we set sail; at<br>noon we had the island due south of us at about 3 miles distance; in<br>the evening at sunset it was south-south-west of us at 6 or 7 miles<br>distance, the island and the rocks lying south-west and north-east of<br>each other. During the night it was pretty calm with an<br>east-south-east wind, our course being north-north-east, very close<br>to the wind, while the tide was running in from the north-east.</p>",

These two islands are nearly<br>south-east and north-west of each other; we could see through between<br>them, where there was a passage about 1\u00bd mile in width. The<br>one to the south-east was the highest, the northernmost one being a<br>low-lying island, much like Holland. To the northernmost we gave the<br>name of Amsterdam<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[3]</b> because of the<br>abundance of refreshments we got there, and the southernmost we<br>christened Middleburch<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[4]</b>.

We showed them white linen, throwing<br>overboard a piece upwards of 1\u00bd fathom in length, which they<br>seeing paddled towards it, but as it had sunk to a considerable depth<br>under the water the foremost man in the prow jumped out and dived for<br>it. He remained under water for a very long time, but at last<br>reappeared with the linen and got into the prow again, where he put<br>it several times atop of his head, in sign of gratitude. They then<br>gradually approached us with their prow, upon which we threw out to<br>them a piece of wood to which we had fastened two large nails; we<br>then handed out to them a small Chinese looking-glass with a string<br>of Chinese beads, which they drew up into their prow by means of a<br>long stick, to which they tied one of their fish-hooks with a small<br>fishing-line, which they handed up to us to show their gratitude.<br>This fish-hook was made of mother-of-pearl and shaped like a small<br>anchovy.

When we had made them a present of the<br>objects aforementioned, and had shown them the coconut and the fowl,<br>they at last paddled back to shore again and made signs to us, as if<br>they were going to fetch the like from shore. At noon and in the<br>afternoon we saw numbers of people walking along the shore, some of<br>them with small white flags which we surmised to be signs of peace<br>and amity. We therefore also hoisted our white flag astern, upon<br>which there came alongside our ship a small prow with four persons in<br>it; they were able-bodied men, having their bodies painted black from<br>the waist to the thighs, their necks hung round with leaves; they<br>carried a small white flag and a cloth made of the bark of trees.<br>They fastened the said flag to the stem of our boat. The outriggers<br>of their prow were trimmed with shells and conches. From these<br>presents and from the embellishments of their prow, which seemed to<br>be distinguished above the others, we concluded that this prow had<br>been sent off by the king or chief of the country. We therefore<br>presented these men with a small Chinese looking-glass, a knife, a<br>piece of dungaree<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[1]</b>, and one or two<br>nails. We filled a rummer of wine for them, from which we first drank<br>ourselves lest they should think we were going to poison them or do<br>them other harm; having taken the rummer they poured out the wine and<br>took the rummer on shore with them. Shortly afterwards a great number<br>of prows came alongside, some of them with 5 or 6, others with 10 or<br>12 coconuts, all of which we bartered against old nails; three or<br>four coconuts against a double middle-sized nail. Some of them came<br>swimming from the land with coconuts, all of which we bartered with<br>them. After some time an aged man came on board of us to whom all the<br>others paid honour, so that we concluded him to be one of their<br>chiefs. We conducted him to the cabin; he did us reverence by<br>inclining his head down to our feet; we paid our respects to him in<br>return after our own fashion, and showed him a cup with fresh water<br>which he showed us by signs to be obtainable on shore; we then<br>presented him with a knife, a small looking-glass, and a piece of<br>dungaree. As they were leaving the cabin one of the natives was<br>caught in the act of stealing the skipper's pistol and a pair of<br>slippers. We took these articles from him again without showing the<br>least dissatisfaction. Many of these people had the lower part of the<br>body painted black down to the knees, some had a mother-of-pearl<br>shell hanging on the breast. Towards evening about 20 prows came<br>close to our ships, which all stationed themselves side by side in<br>regular order. Before coming alongside they made a good deal of<br>noise, crying out repeatedly \"Woo, woo, woo,\" etc., upon which those<br>in our ship sat down. The said prows then came alongside, bringing a<br>present from the king, consisting of a fine large hog, a number of<br>coconuts, and some yams; the bearer of these presents being the same<br>person who brought us the small white flag and the cloth of bark. We<br>presented them in return with a common dish such as we use at meals,<br>and a piece of copper-wire; we also bartered a few coconuts,<br>baccovos<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[2]</b>, yams and a hog, etc.,<br>against nails and beads; about nightfall they all left our ship<br>except one who remained to sleep on board of the Heemskerk.</p>",

We therefore<br>resolved to send ashore the pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz and Skipper<br>Gerrit Jansz with our pinnace together with the two boats, taking<br>with them one of these natives to point out the watering-place to<br>them. We handed into the pinnace a knife, a small looking-glass and a<br>little flag in token of peace, and signified to them that we did not<br>want to have their water without reward or payment. About two hours<br>before sunset our pinnace returned with the Skipper and the<br>pilot-major who reported that, on landing, they had seen from 60 to<br>70 persons seated on the beach, who, as they thought, formed the<br>entire male population of the island; they had no arms but seemed to<br>be a kind and peaceable sort of people; our men also saw many women<br>and children; they conducted our men into the interior by a good<br>path. These people proved to be exceedingly thievish for they stole<br>whatever they could lay hands on, men and women alike. Our men<br>followed them about 2/3 of a mile into the interior, where they came<br>to a fresh inland piece of water, fully 1/4 mile in circumference,<br>and no less than 1\u00bd or 2 fathom above the level of the sea,<br>but they did not know it was so near the shore; as they were going<br>along the said piece of water they found it to be at the northern<br>side of the island, at about a musket-shot distance from the sea,<br>where there was a good sandy bay for landing with the boats, the<br>water being conveniently smooth for embarking the casks; out at sea<br>before the said sandy bay there was a coral reef on which the surf<br>broke with great violence; and since the said coral reef has an<br>opening on the west side it will be possible for our boats at low<br>water to row along the shore and inside the coral reef into the<br>smooth water. But in order to get to the sandy beach the water must<br>first have risen about 1 1/2 or 2 feet higher. This bay was on the<br>north side of the islet and, as our ships were lying on the<br>north-west side, they had to row upwards of a mile along the shore.<br>They were very glad to have found this fresh water. About three hours<br>after sunset our two boats came alongside with filled water-casks,<br>having been prevented from coming earlier by the falling of the<br>water, which here rises and falls about 8 feet. In this fresh water<br>aforesaid they had seen numbers of wild ducks swimming, which were<br>not all shy or afraid of men. These natives brought on board several<br>coconuts and gourds full of water; also some fruit and hogs, but not<br>many; they had prows with sails, as well as smaller ones; their<br>dress, appearance and manners are like those of the inhabitants of<br>the other island, except that as a rule the men have shorter and<br>thinner hair than the others; the women are, comparatively speaking,<br>just as strong and able-bodied as the men.

At noon we, that is to say myself, our skipper,<br>the pilot-major, the skipper and the supercargo of the Zeehaan and<br>the secretary, went on shore with the two boats and the pinnace for<br>the purpose of taking leave of the natives, since it was our<br>intention to depart from here. As soon as we had landed a great<br>multitude of people assembled. We asked two persons who seemed most<br>notable of them after the chief of this district. They conducted us<br>into the interior by narrow, cramped, dirty and miry paths (it having<br>rained very hard for one or two days without interruption). We were<br>first led to the south side of the island where a large number of<br>coconut-trees stood side by side in regular order. Thence they went<br>with us to the east side of the island where six large prows were<br>lying at anchor, each two of them being fastened together by means of<br>a floor of planks and carrying a mast. Here were also one or two<br>small houses ornamented a little above the common, to wit, fenced all<br>round with a bamboo enclosure. After leaving this place we came to a<br>lake or piece of brackish inland water, about a mile in<br>circumference. After staying here for some time we again asked after<br>the Aisy or Latouw (which in their speech means king or chieftain).<br>They then pointed to the far side of this water and, as the sun was<br>close to the horizon already, we returned to our boats along a<br>different path. Both in going and returning we saw many enclosures or<br>gardens with plots elegantly squared and planted with all sorts of<br>earth-fruit. In several places we saw bananas and other fruit-trees,<br>most of them growing so straight that they were good to look at, on<br>all sides emitting a most agreeable and gratifying smell and<br>fragrance. From which we concluded that these people (who had the<br>shape of men but inhuman manners and customs) were by no means<br>destitute of human intelligence. About two hours before sunset we<br>returned on board. These islands are in their average longitude 185<br>miles more to eastward than the Salomonis islands and, according to<br>my estimation, are situated 230 miles east of the easternmost<br>Salomonis islands. These natives know nothing of religion or the<br>service of God, nor have they either idols, other relics, or priests.<br>Still they are very superstitious for I have seen one of these<br>persons take up a watersnake which came floating by his prow, lay it<br>upon his head with great reverence, and then put it into the water<br>again. They will never kill any of the flies which are very plentiful<br>here and cause trouble enough, however many cover their bodies. While<br>we were at anchor</p>",

If one wants to make the coast of New<br>Guinea in the latitude of the Salomonis islands, partly in accordance<br>with the directions and instructions given, though not constituting a<br>positive command, this could not be done without incurring the risk<br>of being cast into a bay from which it might be difficult or<br>impossible to beat out again; and since the east side of New Guinea<br>is still unknown it is quite possible that there may be plenty of<br>small islands and shoals to eastward of the said Land of New Guinea,<br>such as we have already met with before and, having no secure<br>anchorage in such rough weather, in which it is impossible to keep a<br>proper lookout, we might happen to be cast on the shore before we had<br>become aware of the same.<br><br>For which reason we think that from here we should sail northward<br>as close to the wind as shall be found practicable as far as 4 or<br>5\u00b0 South Latitude; the object of our advice being to avoid all<br>risks and prevent our being thrown on a lee-shore, seeing that the<br>coast falls away there, whence we could run to the west in the first<br>instance and next regulate ourselves by wind and weather.<br><br>Signed,<br>FRANCOYS JACOBSZ.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Whereas on the 8th instant we are now having a good deal of rough<br>weather, both with rain and strong north winds, so that we can hardly<br>carry mainsails and cannot see to a quarter of a mile distance, the<br>Commander had convened the council of the Heemskerk, together with<br>the second mates, and desired each of them to give in his opinion in<br>writing; I therefore state as my opinion that we ought to direct our<br>course as far to northward as wind and weather shall permit, nay even<br>due north or north by east, as far as 2 or 3\u00b0 South Latitude, to<br>avoid being cast on the lee-shore of New Guinea; seeing that we are<br>in the bad season here and it is quite possible that we may have got<br>farther to westward than our account makes it, since on the 6th<br>instant we came across 20 or 21 islands lying in 17\u00b0 10' South<br>Latitude, which were not seen by Jacob la Maire.<br><br>This day the 8th of February 1643 on board the Yacht Heemskerk,<br>Latitude estimated 15\u00b0 43', Longitude 199\u00b0 7'.<br><br>Signed,<br>IDE TJERRXZ HOLMAN.<br><br>* * *<br><br>This day the 8th of February A.D. 1643.

Whereas the<br>Commander had this day sent the pilot-major and his secretary on<br>board of us to hear our advices as regards the shaping of our<br>courses, and secondly in what latitude it would be best to touch at<br>the land of New Guinea; my advice touching the point referred to is<br>that we had best touch at the land aforesaid in 4 or 5\u00b0 South<br>Latitude. The reason why I would advise to touch at this land so far<br>to northward is as follows: we have had very rough weather for 6 or 7<br>days past and been in fear of getting into a bay or being cast on a<br>lee-shore; in the latitude aforesaid we should come upon the land in<br>a known latitude; and if we have touched at the land in the said<br>latitude it is likely we shall be able to get to the south if the<br>time at our disposal shall permit us to do so. It is consequently my<br>opinion that we should shape our course as far to northward as<br>possible until we got to the latitude aforesaid and then steer due<br>west until in the latitude aforesaid we come in sight of New Guinea.<br>At this time of writing we were by account in Latitude 15\u00b0 49'<br>south, Longitude 194\u00b0 37'.<br><br>Signed,<br>GERRIT JANSZ.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Advice or reasons why and for what cause we hold it most expedient<br>to navigate to the north.<br><br>Whereas Your Worship has been pleased to ask us to give in our<br>opinion or advice touching the question submitted to us in writing<br>yesterday, my judgment in this matter is as follows: since we are at<br>present in Latitude 15\u00b0 55' south, Longitude 194\u00b0 24', and<br>the weather here about this time of the year would seem to be very<br>variable, while in this region of the world we are as it were at the<br>mercy of winds blowing from all the four quarters, and we do not know<br>how near we have sailed to the land of New Guinea, except what in<br>this respect we can gather from the terrestrial globe and the great<br>chart of the South Sea, we trust that the islands made by the<br>Honourable Commander are the Salomonis islands, seeing that in<br>longitude and latitude we have found them to agree with the<br>indications in the chart of the Portuguese; the said islands cannot<br>have been seen by Schoutens and therefore they may be the land of New<br>Guinea which, according to the Portuguese chart, we might also happen<br>to fall in with.<br><br>For the reason above given it is therefore my opinion, regard<br>being had to the roughness of the weather and to the possibility that<br>we may be nearer to the said land than we suspect, to the fact that<br>we do not know its trend in this latitude and what bays, inlets,<br>bights, shoals and the like there may be in and about it, to the risk<br>that with these northerly winds we may by storm or rough weather be<br>cast and driven on a lee-shore, which would grievously endanger both<br>ship and cargo; it is therefore, I repeat, my opinion that we ought<br>to steer our course north-north-west to the known part of New Guinea<br>about as far as 4 or 5\u00b0 Southern Latitude, and by so doing avoid<br>all perils as much as possible. Given on board the flute-ship the<br>Zeehaan this 15th of February, 1643.<br><br>Signed,<br><br>Your devoted servant,<br>J. GILSEMANS.<br><br>* * *<br><br>My advice is that we ought to make the land of New Guinea in 5 or<br>6\u00b0 South Latitude, seeing that for six days past we have had<br>exceedingly rough weather; that if we should be driven into a bay we<br>might get such weather that it would prove impossible for us to beat<br>out of it; I think that we ought to shape our course as far to<br>northward as the wind will allow us till we got to the latitude<br>aforesaid, and then steer westward in order to make the land of New<br>Guinea. We are at present in Latitude 16\u00b0 3', and Longitude<br>195\u00b0 27' on the 14th of February 1643.<br><br>Signed,<br>HENDRICK PIETERSZ.<br><br>* * *<br><br>This day the 14th of February, 1643.

Some wore<br>white bracelets, seemingly of bone, round their arms; others had<br>their faces daubed with lime, and wore on the forehead a piece of<br>tree-bark about the breadth of three fingers.

We<br>presented them with two strings of beads and two large nails,<br>together with an old napkin, in return for which they gave us an old<br>coconut which was all they had with them, after which they paddled to<br>shore again. Towards the evening it was still calm with a very light<br>breeze from the north-east; we drifted quite close to the islands and<br>had to get out the boats to keep us off the shore by towing. At the<br>close of the dog-watch we at length got clear of these islands. There<br>are two large islands and three small ones, the latter lying on the<br>west side.

We<br>repeatedly made signs to them upon which they at length made bold to<br>paddle alongside of us.

We thought we should have got all three of them for it, but<br>they absolutely refused to part with the other two.

Some<br>of them had a number of small fishes which they threw to our men, but<br>they proved not worth eating. Finally three or four of these people<br>came on board of our ship, looked about them in great amazement, and<br>walked about the ship as if they were intoxicated; a curious<br>circumstance truly, for in their small prows they paddled about for<br>miles out to sea without any signs of sea-sickness, but in a large<br>ship like ours they seem to get intoxicated by the motion caused of<br>the swell of the sea. They had no arms with them, or anything which<br>they could have hurt us. They seemed to subsist by fishing for some<br>of them carried wooden eel-spears. After they had been on board for a<br>while they left together and paddled back to shore with a good deal<br>of bustle and with loud shouts.

The names of the<br>Anachgoddes<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[1]</b> of the junks were Mouna<br>and Jurregan Wanga, besides there was still a free black, Hendrick<br>Jansz of Solor, ensign of the Groene Geuszen<b style=\"color:#0000FF\">[2]</b>. From them we learned that the Honourable<br>Anthony Caen had arrived at Amboyna with a number of vessels with<br>destination for Ternate.
